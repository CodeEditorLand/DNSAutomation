# DNS automation

This repo will manage DNS records automagically. Implementing Infrastructure as
Code & GitOps practices.

Currently we added workflows for handling tauri-ops-test.dev and
tauri-ops-test.net on Cloudflare. You'll find directories for those DNS zones in
./terraform.

In those you can copy one of the record-\*.tf files and modify it for the new
record you want. It will be applied when the commit is pushed to 'dev' branch by
pull request or manually.

Currently _production domains_ are not managed here. Rather we're building out
the workflow and testing in this repository with test domains.
